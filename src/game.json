In the middle of the massive floor sits a single barely-lit brazier in the darkness. You make your way to it with nowhere else to turn.\nYou stare into the flames and feel the heat against the cold dampness you've grown accustomed to. Behind you, you hear a creature smack its lips exactly once. You turn around to see a hideous meat monster, gross and deformed. Long and gangly like a lizard with arms, legs, and eyes of all different shapes and sizes protruding in every direction. At the top sits a large open hole with rows of shark-like teeth. This hold moves as the monster speaks to you. Its voice raises chills up your spine.\n\"For decades this family served me greatly. They found me poor and decrepit. I was on the brink of death. I promised them if they would feed me the joy in a human soul that I would grant them powers beyond their wildest dreams. Myrna loved this idea. She gladly drew in the town's visitors into her private 'wine cellar' so that I could devour their happiness and gain strength. I gave her the ability to control the minds of others. She coudl just as easily lure victims into my lair as she could influence the governors of the town or the barrons sitting on their piles of gold.\n\"However, Ronald seemed to have a weakness. He cared too much for the children. He pretended to go along with it, but I knew. I always know. He was planning to slay me in an attempt to protect his pathetic brats. So I gave Myrna a task. She was to use her powers to convince Ronald to feed himself to me. Her power was so great that it was no problem for her. But it turns out she was weak too. After all I had done for her, a part of her broke when she was I had eaten her lover. I saw this weakness, and I ate her as well.\n\"This was foolish on my part, for now I have not eaten in centuries. Don't worry, puny human. It won't be painful. But I will not hesitate. You will be mine. I am starving.",
